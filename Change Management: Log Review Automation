# Change Management: Audit Accountability Modernization (SOP-873-06)

## 1. Objective
To modernize the Audit and Accountability procedures at Artemis Consulting, moving from manual monthly oversight to an automated, decentralized verification model.

## 2. Process Transformation
| Feature | Legacy Process (v1.0) | Automated Process (v2.0) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | Monthly (Last Friday) | At least Bi-Weekly |
| **Evidence Collection** | Manual CSV Exports | Automated Teams Adaptive Cards |
| **Audit Trail** | Dispersed Excel Files | Centralized SharePoint List |
| **Fail-Safe** | None (Reliant on Memory) | 7-Day Escalation Logic |

## 3. Technical Implementation
- **Workflow:** Power Automate Recurrence Engine.
- **Data Hook:** Custom JSON Adaptive Cards mapping to `Compliance Log Review` SharePoint schema.
- **Escalation:** Conditional branching to notify Lead Systems Administrator of verification timeouts.

## 4. Compliance Mapping (CMMC 2.0 / NIST 800-171)
- **AC.L2-3.1.12 (Control Monitoring):** Decentralized verification ensures "eyes-on" logs by delegated technicians.
- **AU.L2-3.3.1 (Audit Logging):** Centralized SharePoint repository provides a non-repudiable system of record for auditors.

## 5. Summary of Changes
Revision v2.0 (Feb 3, 2026) codified the use of automation as the primary method for audit review. Manual procedures (M365 Audit Search/PreVeil Data Export) remain in the SOP as the "standardized steps" technicians must follow before submitting their digital verification.

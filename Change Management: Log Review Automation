# Change Management: Log Review Automation (v2.0)

## 1. Problem Statement
The legacy SOP-873-06 (v1.0) relied on manual monthly reviews of disparate logs (M365, PreVeil, Sentinel). This manual process was prone to "compliance drift," lacked a real-time audit trail, and provided no escalation path for missed reviews.

## 2. Solution: Automated Verification Engine
I engineered a Power Automate solution to modernize Artemis Consulting's audit accountability.
- **Trigger:** Bi-weekly recurrence to increase audit frequency by 100%.
- **Interface:** Interactive Microsoft Teams Adaptive Cards for decentralized technician verification.
- **Persistence:** Direct integration with SharePoint Online for automated record keeping.

## 3. Compliance Impact (CMMC AC.L2-3.1.12)
- **Non-Repudiation:** Automated capture of technician identity and timestamps.
- **Governance:** Implemented a 7-day timeout escalation to ensure 100% audit coverage.
- **Review:** Centralized a 'Biweekly Meeting View' for senior admin sign-off.

## 4. Implementation Details
The SOP was updated on Feb 3, 2026, to reflect the decommission of manual monthly exports in favor of this automated lifecycle.

# Change Management: Audit Accountability Modernization (v2.0)

## 1. Objective
To modernize the Audit and Accountability procedures at Artemis Consulting, moving from manual monthly oversight to an automated, decentralized verification model.

## 2. Process Transformation
| Feature | Legacy Process (v1.0) | Automated Process (v2.0) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frequency** | Monthly (Last Friday) | At least Bi-Weekly |
| **Evidence Collection** | Manual CSV Exports | Automated Teams Adaptive Cards |
| **Audit Trail** | Dispersed Excel Files | Centralized SharePoint List |
| **Fail-Safe** | None (Reliant on Memory) | 7-Day Escalation Logic |

## 3. Human-in-the-Loop Verification
To maintain high-fidelity auditing, the automation does not replace the technical review. Technicians follow the "Technical Verification Protocol" (manual log analysis) before utilizing the Teams Adaptive Card for digital sign-off.

## 4. Compliance Mapping (CMMC 2.0 / NIST 800-171)
- **AC.L2-3.1.12 (Control Monitoring):** Decentralized verification ensures "eyes-on" logs.
- **AU.L2-3.3.1 (Audit Logging):** Centralized SharePoint repository provides a non-repudiable system of record.
